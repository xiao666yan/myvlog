It takes the URL to the SVG file or the text of the SVG file, parses it in JavaScript and renders the result on Canvas. It also can be used to rasterize SVG images.\n\n<a href=\"#quickstart\">Quickstart</a>\n<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n<a href=\"#docs\">Docs</a>\n<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>\n<a href=\"https://canvg.js.org/demo/\">Demo</a>\n<br />\n<hr />\n\n## Quickstart\n\nInstall this library using your favorite package manager:\n\n```sh\npnpm add canvg\n# or\nyarn add canvg\n# or\nnpm i canvg\n```\n\nThen, just import `Canvg` and use it:\n\n```js\nimport { Canvg } from 'canvg';\n\nlet v = null;\n\nwindow.onload = async () => {\n  const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');\n  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\n\n  v = await Canvg.from(ctx, './svgs/1.svg');\n\n  // Start SVG rendering with animations and mouse handling.\n  v.start();\n};\n\nwindow.onbeforeunload = () => {\n  v.stop();\n};\n```\n\n[Description of all exports you can find in Documentation.](https://canvg.js.org/api)\n\n<br />\n\n## Docs\n\n- [Migration to v4](https://canvg.js.org/docs/migration-to-v4)\n- [API](https://canvg.js.org/api/classes/Canvg)\n- [Examples](https://canvg.js.org/examples)\n\n## What's implemented?\n\nThe end goal is everything from the [SVG spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/). The majority of the rendering and animation is working. If you would like to see a feature implemented, don't hesitate to add it to the issues list, or better is to create pull request 😎\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-26T15:02:17.739Z","modified":"2025-03-13T18:55:24.245Z","3.0.10":"2022-01-27T18:53:15.187Z","3.0.9":"2021-10-05T01:28:52.954Z","3.0.8":"2021-09-14T05:13:56.480Z","3.0.7":"2020-10-17T06:19:51.111Z","3.0.6":"2020-03-24T19:16:29.611Z","3.0.5":"2020-01-29T08:08:53.981Z","3.0.4":"2020-01-07T06:56:45.720Z","3.0.2":"2019-12-06T07:43:44.073Z","3.0.1":"2019-12-04T05:10:53.987Z","3.0.0":"2019-12-04T04:33:59.892Z","3.0.0-beta.4":"2019-12-01T22:48:17.330Z","3.0.0-beta.3":"2019-11-12T02:36:00.958Z","3.0.0-beta.2":"2019-11-06T04:40:22.280Z","3.0.0-beta.1":"2019-11-05T07:06:01.922Z","3.0.0-beta.0":"2019-11-03T04:52:51.319Z","2.0.0":"2019-05-18T17:43:48.977Z","2.0.0-beta.1":"2019-03-08T16:17:22.514Z","2.0.0-beta.0":"2019-01-14T05:59:06.187Z","1.5.3":"2018-09-09T15:21:10.450Z","1.5.2":"2018-08-08T02:14:20.509Z","1.5.1":"2018-08-08T01:06:57.067Z","1.0.0":"2018-03-09T01:51:03.430Z","0.0.8":"2015-01-24T18:55:06.219Z","0.0.7":"2014-12-10T08:06:00.868Z","0.0.6":"2014-10-24T14:34:06.980Z","0.0.5":"2014-02-11T19:08:24.009Z","0.0.4":"2013-04-23T07:43:00.641Z","0.0.3":"2013-02-22T05:08:51.675Z","0.0.2":"2012-12-21T15:17:56.569Z","0.0.1":"2012-12-14T14:13:37.995Z","4.0.0":"2022-02-17T13:30:38.733Z","4.0.1":"2022-07-19T13:32:15.671Z","4.0.2":"2024-04-22T17:10:09.759Z","4.0.3":"2025-03-12T23:04:02.997Z","3.0.11":"2025-03-13T18:29:07.067Z"},"versions":{"3.0.10":{"name":"canvg","version":"3.0.10","description":"JavaScript SVG parser and renderer on Canvas.","authors":[{"name":"Gabe Lerner","email":"gabelerner@gmail.com"},{"name":"Brett Zamir"},{"name":"Dan Green","url":"https://twitter.com/dangreen58"}],"license":"MIT","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/canvg/canvg"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/canvg/canvg/issues"},"type":"module","sideEffects":false,"main":"lib/index.cjs","module":"lib/index.es.js","raw":"lib/index.babel.js","umd":"lib/umd.js","types":"lib/index.d.ts","exports":{"require":"./lib/index.cjs","import":"./lib/index.es.js"},"engines":{"node":">=10.0.0"},"keywords":["javascript","client","browser","svg","canvas"],"dependencies":{"@babel/runtime":"^7.12.5","@types/raf":"^3.4.0","core-js":"^3.8.3","raf":"^3.4.1","regenerator-runtime":"^0.13.7","rgbcolor":"^1.0.1","stackblur-canvas":"^2.0.0","svg-pathdata":"^6.0.3"},"licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010 - present Gabe Lerner (gabelerner@gmail.com) - https://github.com/canvg/canvg\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
