Especially useful for applications running on Google Cloud. Application Default Credentials also support workload identity federation to access Google Cloud resources from non-Google Cloud platforms.\n- [OAuth 2](#oauth2) - Use OAuth2 when you need to perform actions on behalf of the end user.\n- [JSON Web Tokens](#json-web-tokens) - Use JWT when you are using a single identity for all users. Especially useful for server->server or server->API communication.\n- [Google Compute](#compute) - Directly use a service account on Google Cloud Platform. Useful for server->server or server->API communication.\n- [Workload Identity Federation](#workload-identity-federation) - Use workload identity federation to access Google Cloud resources from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure or any identity provider that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC).\n- [Workforce Identity Federation](#workforce-identity-federation) - Use workforce identity federation to access Google Cloud resources using an external identity provider (IdP) to authenticate and authorize a workforce—a group of users, such as employees, partners, and contractors—using IAM, so that the users can access Google Cloud services.\n- [Impersonated Credentials Client](#impersonated-credentials-client) - access protected resources on behalf of another service account.\n- [Downscoped Client](#downscoped-client) - Use Downscoped Client with Credential Access Boundary to generate a short-lived credential with downscoped, restricted IAM permissions that can use for Cloud Storage.\n\n## Application Default Credentials\n\nThis library provides an implementation of [Application Default Credentials (ADC)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) for Node.js. ADC provides a simple way to get credentials for use in calling Google APIs. How you [set up ADC](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc) depends on the environment where your code is running.\n\nADC is best suited for cases when the call needs to have the same identity and authorization level for the application independent of the user. This is the recommended approach to authorize calls to Cloud APIs, particularly when you're building an application that uses Google Cloud Platform.\n\nApplication Default Credentials also supports Workload Identity Federation to access Google Cloud resources from non-Google Cloud platforms including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure or any identity provider that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC). Workload Identity Federation is recommended for non-Google Cloud environments as it avoids the need to download, manage and store service account private keys locally, see: [Workload Identity Federation](#workload-identity-federation).\n\n#### Enable the API you want to use\n\nBefore making your API call, you must be sure the API you're calling has been enabled. Go to **APIs & Auth** > **APIs** in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and enable the APIs you'd like to call. For the example below, you must enable the `DNS API`.\n\n\n#### Choosing the correct credential type automatically\n\nRather than manually creating an OAuth2 client, JWT client, or Compute client, the auth library can create the correct credential type for you, depending upon the environment your code is running under.\n\nFor example, a JWT auth client will be created when your code is running on your local developer machine, and a Compute client will be created when the same code is running on Google Cloud Platform. If you need a specific set of scopes, you can pass those in the form of a string or an array to the `GoogleAuth` constructor.\n\nThe code below shows how to retrieve a default credential type, depending upon the runtime environment.\n\n```js\nconst {GoogleAuth} = require('google-auth-library');\n\n/**\n* Instead of specifying the type of client you'd like to use (JWT, OAuth2, etc)\n* this library will automatically choose the right client based on the environment.\n*/\nconst auth = new GoogleAuth({\n  scopes: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'\n});\nconst projectId = await auth.getProjectId();\nconst url = `https://dns.googleapis.com/dns/v1/projects/${projectId}`;\n// The modern `fetch` and classic `request` APIs are available\nconst res = await auth.fetch(url);\nconsole.log(res.data);\n```\n\n## OAuth2\n\nThis library comes with an [OAuth2](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2) client that allows you to retrieve an access token and refreshes the token and retry the request seamlessly if you also provide an `expiry_date` and the token is expired. The basics of Google's OAuth2 implementation is explained on [Google authorization and Authentication documentation](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2Login).\n\nIn the following examples, you may need a `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET` and `REDIRECT_URL`. You can find these pieces of information by going to the [Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), clicking your project > APIs & auth > credentials.\n\nFor more information about OAuth2 and how it works, [see here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2).\n\n#### A complete OAuth2 example\n\nLet's take a look at a complete example.\n\n``` js\nconst {OAuth2Client} = require('google-auth-library');\nconst http = require('http');\nconst url = require('url');\nconst open = require('open');\nconst destroyer = require('server-destroy');\n\n// Download your OAuth2 configuration from the Google\nconst keys = require('./oauth2.keys.json');\n\n/**\n* Start by acquiring a pre-authenticated oAuth2 client.\n*/\nasync function main() {\n  const oAuth2Client = await getAuthenticatedClient();\n  // Make a simple request to the People API using our pre-authenticated client. The `fetch` and\n  // `request` methods accept a [`GaxiosOptions`](https://github.com/googleapis/gaxios)\n  // object.\n  const url = 'https://people.googleapis.com/v1/people/me?personFields=names';\n  const res = await oAuth2Client.fetch(url);\n  console.log(res.data);\n\n  // After acquiring an access_token, you may want to check on the audience, expiration,\n  // or original scopes requested.  You can do that with the `getTokenInfo` method.\n  const tokenInfo = await oAuth2Client.getTokenInfo(\n    oAuth2Client.credentials.access_token\n  );\n  console.log(tokenInfo);\n}\n\n/**\n* Create a new OAuth2Client, and go through the OAuth2 content\n* workflow.  Return the full client to the callback.\n*/\nfunction getAuthenticatedClient() {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    // create an oAuth client to authorize the API call.  Secrets are kept in a `keys.json` file,\n    // which should be downloaded from the Google Developers Console.\n    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client({\n      clientId: keys.web.client_id,\n      clientSecret: keys.web.client_secret,\n      redirectUri: keys.web.redirect_uris[0]\n    });\n\n    // Generate the url that will be used for the consent dialog.\n    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n      access_type: 'offline',\n      scope: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile',\n    });\n\n    // Open an http server to accept the oauth callback. In this simple example, the\n    // only request to our webserver is to /oauth2callback?code=<code>\n    const server = http\n      .createServer(async (req, res) => {\n        try {\n          if (req.url.indexOf('/oauth2callback') > -1) {\n            // acquire the code from the querystring, and close the web server.\n            const qs = new url.URL(req.url, 'http://localhost:3000')\n              .searchParams;\n            const code = qs.get('code');\n            console.log(`Code is ${code}`);\n            res.end('Authentication successful! Please return to the console.');\n            server.destroy();\n\n            // Now that we have the code, use that to acquire tokens.\n            const r = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n            // Make sure to set the credentials on the OAuth2 client.\n            oAuth2Client.setCredentials(r.tokens);\n            console.info('Tokens acquired.');\n            resolve(oAuth2Client);\n          }\n        } catch (e) {\n          reject(e);\n        }\n      })\n      .listen(3000, () => {\n        // open the browser to the authorize url to start the workflow\n        open(authorizeUrl, {wait: false}).then(cp => cp.unref());\n      });\n    destroyer(server);\n  });\n}\n\nmain().catch(console.error);\n```\n\n#### Handling token events\n\nThis library will automatically obtain an `access_token`, and automatically refresh the `access_token` if a `refresh_token` is present.  The `refresh_token` is only returned on the [first authorization](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client/issues/750#issuecomment-304521450), so if you want to make sure you store it safely. An easy way to make sure you always store the most recent tokens is to use the `tokens` event:\n\n```js\nconst auth = new GoogleAuth();\nconst client = await auth.getClient();\n\nclient.on('tokens', (tokens) => {\n  if (tokens.refresh_token) {\n    // store the refresh_token in my database!\n    console.log(tokens.refresh_token);\n  }\n  console.log(tokens.access_token);\n});\n\nconst projectId = await auth.getProjectId();\nconst url = `https://dns.googleapis.com/dns/v1/projects/${projectId}`;\n// The `tokens` event would now be raised if this was the first request\nconst res = await client.fetch(url);\n```\n\n#### Retrieve access token\nWith the code returned, you can ask for an access token as shown below:\n\n``` js\nconst tokens = await oauth2Client.getToken(code);\n// Now tokens contains an access_token and an optional refresh_token. Save them.\noauth2Client.setCredentials(tokens);\n```\n\n#### Obtaining a new Refresh Token\nIf you need to obtain a new `refresh_token`, ensure the call to `generateAuthUrl` sets the `access_type` to `offline`.  The refresh token will only be returned for the first authorization by the user.  To force consent, set the `prompt` property to `consent`:\n\n```js\n// Generate the url that will be used for the consent dialog.\nconst authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n  // To get a refresh token, you MUST set access_type to `offline`.\n  access_type: 'offline',\n  // set the appropriate scopes\n  scope: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile',\n  // A refresh token is only returned the first time the user\n  // consents to providing access.  For illustration purposes,\n  // setting the prompt to 'consent' will force this consent\n  // every time, forcing a refresh_token to be returned.\n  prompt: 'consent'\n});\n```\n\n#### Checking `access_token` information\nAfter obtaining and storing an `access_token`, at a later time you may want to go check the expiration date,\noriginal scopes, or audience for the token.  To get the token info, you can use the `getTokenInfo` method:\n\n```js\n// after acquiring an oAuth2Client...\nconst tokenInfo = await oAuth2Client.getTokenInfo('my-access-token');\n\n// take a look at the scopes originally provisioned for the access token\nconsole.log(tokenInfo.scopes);\n```\n\nThis method will throw if the token is invalid.\n\n#### Using an API Key\n\nAn API key can be provided to the constructor:\n```js\nconst client = new OAuth2Client({\n  apiKey: 'my-api-key'\n});\n```\n\nNote, classes that extend from this can utilize this parameter as well, such as `JWT` and `UserRefreshClient`.\n\nAdditionally, an API key can be used in `GoogleAuth` via the `clientOptions` parameter and will be passed to any generated `OAuth2Client` instances:\n```js\nconst auth = new GoogleAuth({\n  clientOptions: {\n    apiKey: 'my-api-key'\n  }\n})\n```\n\nAPI Key support varies by API.\n\n## JSON Web Tokens\nThe Google Developers Console provides a `.json` file that you can use to configure a JWT auth client and authenticate your requests, for example when using a service account.\n\n``` js\nconst {JWT} = require('google-auth-library');\nconst keys = require('./jwt.keys.json');\n\nconst client = new JWT({\n  email: keys.client_email,\n  key: keys.private_key,\n  scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'],\n});\nconst url = `https://dns.googleapis.com/dns/v1/projects/${keys.project_id}`;\nconst res = await client.fetch(url);\nconsole.log(res.data);\n```\n\nThe parameters for the JWT auth client including how to use it with a `.pem` file are explained in [samples/jwt.js](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs/blob/main/samples/jwt.js).\n\n#### Loading credentials from environment variables\nInstead of loading credentials from a key file, you can also provide them using an environment variable.  This is particularly convenient for systems that deploy directly from source control (Heroku, App Engine, etc).\n\nStart by exporting your credentials:\n\n```\n$ export CREDS='{\n  \"type\": \"service_account\",\n  \"project_id\": \"your-project-id\",\n  \"private_key_id\": \"your-private-key-id\",\n  \"private_key\": \"your-private-key\",\n  \"client_email\": \"your-client-email\",\n  \"client_id\": \"your-client-id\",\n  \"auth_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\",\n  \"token_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token\",\n  \"auth_provider_x509_cert_url\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs\",\n  \"client_x509_cert_url\": \"your-cert-url\"\n}'\n```\nNow you can create a new client from the credentials:\n\n```js\nconst {JWT} = require('google-auth-library');\n\n// load the environment variable with our keys\nconst keysEnvVar = process.env['CREDS'];\nif (!keysEnvVar) {\n  throw new Error('The $CREDS environment variable was not found!');\n}\nconst keys = JSON.parse(keysEnvVar);\n\n// create a JWT client\nconst client = new JWT({\n  email: keys.client_email,\n  key: keys.private_key,\n  scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'],\n});\nconst url = `https://dns.googleapis.com/dns/v1/projects/${keys.project_id}`;\nconst res = await client.fetch(url);\nconsole.log(res.data);\n```\n\n**Important**: If you accept a credential configuration (credential JSON/File/Stream) from an external source for authentication to Google Cloud, you must validate it before providing it to any Google API or library. Providing an unvalidated credential configuration to Google APIs can compromise the security of your systems and data. For more information, refer to [Validate credential configurations from external sources](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/externally-sourced-credentials).\n\n#### Using a Proxy\nYou can set the `HTTPS_PROXY` or `https_proxy` environment variables to proxy HTTPS requests. When `HTTPS_PROXY` or `https_proxy` are set, they will be used to proxy SSL requests that do not have an explicit proxy configuration option present.\n\n## Compute\nIf your application is running on Google Cloud Platform, you can authenticate using the default service account or by specifying a specific service account.\n\n**Note**: In most cases, you will want to use [Application Default Credentials](#choosing-the-correct-credential-type-automatically).  Direct use of the `Compute` class is for very specific scenarios.\n\n``` js\nconst {auth, Compute} = require('google-auth-library');\n\nconst client = new Compute({\n  // Specifying the service account email is optional.\n  serviceAccountEmail: 'my-service-account@example.com'\n});\nconst projectId = await auth.getProjectId();\nconst url = `https://dns.googleapis.com/dns/v1/projects/${projectId}`;\nconst res = await client.fetch(url);\nconsole.log(res.data);\n```\n\n## Workload Identity Federation\n\nUsing workload identity federation, your application can access Google Cloud resources from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure or any identity provider that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC).\n\nTraditionally, applications running outside Google Cloud have used service account keys to access Google Cloud resources. Using identity federation, you can allow your workload to impersonate a service account.\nThis lets you access Google Cloud resources directly, eliminating the maintenance and security burden associated with service account keys.\n\n### Accessing resources from AWS\n\nIn order to access Google Cloud resources from Amazon Web Services (AWS), the following requirements are needed:\n- A workload identity pool needs to be created.\n- AWS needs to be added as an identity provider in the workload identity pool (The Google [organization policy](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-workload-identity-pools-providers#restrict) needs to allow federation from AWS).\n- Permission to impersonate a service account needs to be granted to the external identity.\n\nFollow the detailed [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/access-resources-aws) on how to configure workload identity federation from AWS.\n\nAfter configuring the AWS provider to impersonate a service account, a credential configuration file needs to be generated.\nUnlike service account credential files, the generated credential configuration file will only contain non-sensitive metadata to instruct the library on how to retrieve external subject tokens and exchange them for service account access tokens.\nThe configuration file can be generated by using the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).\n\nTo generate the AWS workload identity configuration, run the following command:\n\n```bash\n# Generate an AWS configuration file.\ngcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config \\\n    projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$POOL_ID/providers/$AWS_PROVIDER_ID \\\n    --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \\\n    --aws \\\n    --output-file /path/to/generated/config.json\n```\n\nWhere the following variables need to be substituted:\n- `$PROJECT_NUMBER`: The Google Cloud project number.\n- `$POOL_ID`: The workload identity pool ID.\n- `$AWS_PROVIDER_ID`: The AWS provider ID.\n- `$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: The email of the service account to impersonate.\n\nThis will generate the configuration file in the specified output file.\n\nIf you want to use the AWS IMDSv2 flow, you can add the field below to the credential_source in your AWS ADC configuration file:\n\"imdsv2_session_token_url\": \"http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token\"\nThe gcloud create-cred-config command will be updated to support this soon.\n\nYou can now [start using the Auth library](#using-external-identities) to call Google Cloud resources from AWS.\n\n### Accessing resources from AWS using a custom AWS security credentials supplier.\n\nIn order to access Google Cloud resources from Amazon Web Services (AWS), the following requirements are needed:\n- A workload identity pool needs to be created.\n- AWS needs to be added as an identity provider in the workload identity pool (The Google [organization policy](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-workload-identity-pools-providers#restrict) needs to allow federation from AWS).\n- Permission to impersonate a service account needs to be granted to the external identity.\n\nFollow the detailed [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/access-resources-aws) on how to configure workload identity federation from AWS.\n\nIf you want to use AWS security credentials that cannot be retrieved using methods supported natively by this library,\na custom AwsSecurityCredentialsSupplier implementation may be specified when creating an AWS client. The supplier must\nreturn valid, unexpired AWS security credentials when called by the GCP credential. Currently, using ADC with your AWS\nworkloads is only supported with EC2. An example of a good use case for using a custom credential suppliers is when\nyour workloads are running in other AWS environments, such as ECS, EKS, Fargate, etc.\n\nNote that the client does not cache the returned AWS security credentials, so caching logic should be implemented in the supplier to prevent multiple requests for the same resources.\n\nFor a sample on how to access Google Cloud resources from AWS with a custom credential supplier, see [samples/customCredentialSupplierAwsWorkload.js](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs/blob/main/samples/customCredentialSupplierAwsWorkload.js).\n\n```ts\nimport { AwsClient, AwsSecurityCredentials, AwsSecurityCredentialsSupplier, ExternalAccountSupplierContext } from 'google-auth-library';\nimport { fromNodeProviderChain } from '@aws-sdk/credential-providers';\nimport { Storage } from '@google-cloud/storage';\n\nclass AwsSupplier implements AwsSecurityCredentialsSupplier {\n  private readonly region: string\n\n  constructor(region: string) {\n    this.region = region;\n  }\n\n  async getAwsRegion(context: ExternalAccountSupplierContext): Promise<string> {\n    // Return the AWS region i.e. \"us-east-2\".\n    return this.region\n  }\n\n  async getAwsSecurityCredentials(\n    context: ExternalAccountSupplierContext\n  ): Promise<AwsSecurityCredentials> {\n    // Retrieve the AWS credentails.\n    const awsCredentialsProvider = fromNodeProviderChain();\n    const awsCredentials = await awsCredentialsProvider();\n\n    // Parse the AWS credentials into a AWS security credentials instance and\n    // return them.\n    const awsSecurityCredentials = {\n      accessKeyId: awsCredentials.accessKeyId,\n      secretAccessKey: awsCredentials.secretAccessKey,\n      token: awsCredentials.sessionToken\n    }\n    return awsSecurityCredentials;\n  }\n}\n\nconst clientOptions = {\n  audience: '//iam.googleapis.com/projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$WORKLOAD_POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID', // Set the GCP audience.\n  subject_token_type: 'urn:ietf:params:aws:token-type:aws4_request', // Set the subject token type.\n  aws_security_credentials_supplier: new AwsSupplier(\"AWS_REGION\"), // Set the custom supplier.\n  service_account_impersonation_url: 'https://iamcredentials.googleapis.com/v1/projects/-/serviceAccounts/$EMAIL:generateAccessToken', // Set the service account impersonation url.\n}\n\n// Create a new Auth client and use it to create service client, i.e. storage.\nconst authClient = new AwsClient(clientOptions);\nconst storage = new Storage({ authClient });\n```\n\nWhere the [audience](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-for-using-workload-identity-federation#provider-audience) is: `//iam.googleapis.com/projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$WORKLOAD_POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID`\n\nWhere the following variables need to be substituted:\n\n* `$PROJECT_NUMBER`: The Google Cloud project number.\n* `$WORKLOAD_POOL_ID`: The workload pool ID.\n* `$PROVIDER_ID`: The provider ID.\n\n\nThe values for audience, service account impersonation URL, and any other builder field can also be found by generating a [credential configuration file with the gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/workload-identity-pools/create-cred-config).\n\n### Access resources from Microsoft Azure\n\nIn order to access Google Cloud resources from Microsoft Azure, the following requirements are needed:\n- A workload identity pool needs to be created.\n- Azure needs to be added as an identity provider in the workload identity pool (The Google [organization policy](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-workload-identity-pools-providers#restrict) needs to allow federation from Azure).\n- The Azure tenant needs to be configured for identity federation.\n- Permission to impersonate a service account needs to be granted to the external identity.\n\nFollow the detailed [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/access-resources-azure) on how to configure workload identity federation from Microsoft Azure.\n\nAfter configuring the Azure provider to impersonate a service account, a credential configuration file needs to be generated.\nUnlike service account credential files, the generated credential configuration file will only contain non-sensitive metadata to instruct the library on how to retrieve external subject tokens and exchange them for service account access tokens.\nThe configuration file can be generated by using the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).\n\nTo generate the Azure workload identity configuration, run the following command:\n\n```bash\n# Generate an Azure configuration file.\ngcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config \\\n    projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$POOL_ID/providers/$AZURE_PROVIDER_ID \\\n    --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \\\n    --azure \\\n    --output-file /path/to/generated/config.json\n```\n\nWhere the following variables need to be substituted:\n- `$PROJECT_NUMBER`: The Google Cloud project number.\n- `$POOL_ID`: The workload identity pool ID.\n- `$AZURE_PROVIDER_ID`: The Azure provider ID.\n- `$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: The email of the service account to impersonate.\n\nThis will generate the configuration file in the specified output file.\n\nYou can now [start using the Auth library](#using-external-identities) to call Google Cloud resources from Azure.\n\n### Accessing resources from an OIDC identity provider\n\nIn order to access Google Cloud resources from an identity provider that supports [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/connect/), the following requirements are needed:\n- A workload identity pool needs to be created.\n- An OIDC identity provider needs to be added in the workload identity pool (The Google [organization policy](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-workload-identity-pools-providers#restrict) needs to allow federation from the identity provider).\n- Permission to impersonate a service account needs to be granted to the external identity.\n\nFollow the detailed [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/access-resources-oidc) on how to configure workload identity federation from an OIDC identity provider.\n\nAfter configuring the OIDC provider to impersonate a service account, a credential configuration file needs to be generated.\nUnlike service account credential files, the generated credential configuration file will only contain non-sensitive metadata to instruct the library on how to retrieve external subject tokens and exchange them for service account access tokens.\nThe configuration file can be generated by using the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).\n\nFor OIDC providers, the Auth library can retrieve OIDC tokens either from a local file location (file-sourced credentials) or from a local server (URL-sourced credentials).\n\n**File-sourced credentials**\nFor file-sourced credentials, a background process needs to be continuously refreshing the file location with a new OIDC token prior to expiration.\nFor tokens with one hour lifetimes, the token needs to be updated in the file every hour. The token can be stored directly as plain text or in JSON format.\n\nTo generate a file-sourced OIDC configuration, run the following command:\n\n```bash\n# Generate an OIDC configuration file for file-sourced credentials.\ngcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config \\\n    projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$POOL_ID/providers/$OIDC_PROVIDER_ID \\\n    --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \\\n    --credential-source-file $PATH_TO_OIDC_ID_TOKEN \\\n    # Optional arguments for file types. Default is \"text\":\n    # --credential-source-type \"json\" \\\n    # Optional argument for the field that contains the OIDC credential.\n    # This is required for json.\n    # --credential-source-field-name \"id_token\" \\\n    --output-file /path/to/generated/config.json\n```\n\nWhere the following variables need to be substituted:\n- `$PROJECT_NUMBER`: The Google Cloud project number.\n- `$POOL_ID`: The workload identity pool ID.\n- `$OIDC_PROVIDER_ID`: The OIDC provider ID.\n- `$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: The email of the service account to impersonate.\n- `$PATH_TO_OIDC_ID_TOKEN`: The file path where the OIDC token will be retrieved from.\n\nThis will generate the configuration file in the specified output file.\n\n**URL-sourced credentials**\nFor URL-sourced credentials, a local server needs to host a GET endpoint to return the OIDC token. The response can be in plain text or JSON.\nAdditional required request headers can also be specified.\n\nTo generate a URL-sourced OIDC workload identity configuration, run the following command:\n\n```bash\n# Generate an OIDC configuration file for URL-sourced credentials.\ngcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config \\\n    projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$POOL_ID/providers/$OIDC_PROVIDER_ID \\\n    --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \\\n    --credential-source-url $URL_TO_GET_OIDC_TOKEN \\\n    --credential-source-headers $HEADER_KEY=$HEADER_VALUE \\\n    # Optional arguments for file types. Default is \"text\":\n    # --credential-source-type \"json\" \\\n    # Optional argument for the field that contains the OIDC credential.\n    # This is required for json.\n    # --credential-source-field-name \"id_token\" \\\n    --output-file /path/to/generated/config.json\n```\n\nWhere the following variables need to be substituted:\n- `$PROJECT_NUMBER`: The Google Cloud project number.\n- `$POOL_ID`: The workload identity pool ID.\n- `$OIDC_PROVIDER_ID`: The OIDC provider ID.\n- `$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: The email of the service account to impersonate.\n- `$URL_TO_GET_OIDC_TOKEN`: The URL of the local server endpoint to call to retrieve the OIDC token.\n- `$HEADER_KEY` and `$HEADER_VALUE`: The additional header key/value pairs to pass along the GET request to `$URL_TO_GET_OIDC_TOKEN`, e.g. `Metadata-Flavor=Google`.\n\n### X.509 certificate-sourced credentials\nFor [X.509 certificate-sourced credentials](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-x509-certificates), we use the certificate and private key cryptographic pair used to prove your application's identity. The certificate has a built-in expiration date and must be renewed before that date to maintain access. \n\n**Generating Configuration Files for X.509 Federation**\n\nTo configure X.509 certificate-sourced credentials, you must generate two separate configuration files: a primary **credential configuration file** and a **certificate configuration file**. The `gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config` command handles the creation of both.\n\nThe location where the certificate configuration file is created depends on whether you use the `--credential-cert-configuration-output-file` flag.\n\n**Default Behavior (Recommended)**\n\nIf you omit the `--credential-cert-configuration-output-file` flag, gcloud creates the certificate configuration file at a default, well-known location that client libraries can automatically discover. This is the simplest approach for most use cases.\n\n**Example Command (Default Behavior):**\n```bash\ngcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config \\\n    projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID \\\n    --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \\\n    --credential-cert-path \"$PATH_TO_CERTIFICATE\" \\\n    --credential-cert-private-key-path \"$PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY\" \\\n    --credential-cert-trust-chain-path \"$PATH_TO_TRUST_CHAIN\" \\\n    --output-file /path/to/config.json\n```    \nthe following variables need to be substituted:\n- `$PROJECT_NUMBER`: The Google Cloud project number.\n- `$POOL_ID`: The workload identity pool ID.\n- `$PROVIDER_ID`: The provider ID.\n- `$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: The email of the service account to impersonate.\n- `$PATH_TO_CERTIFICATE`: The file path where your leaf X.509 certificate is located.\n- `$PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY`: The file path where the corresponding private key (.key) for the leaf certificate is located.\n- `$PATH_TO_TRUST_CHAIN`: Points to the file path of the X.509 certificate trust chain file, containing any intermediate certificates required to complete the trust chain between the leaf certificate and the trust store configured in the Workload Identity Federation pool.\n\nThis command results in:\n- `/path/to/config.json`: Created at the path you specified. This file will contain   `\"use_default_certificate_config\": true` to instruct clients to look for the certificate configuration at the default path.\n- `certificate_config.json`: Created at the default gcloud configuration path, which is typically `~/.config/gcloud/certificate_config.json` on Linux and macOS, or `%APPDATA%\\gcloud\\certificate_config.json` on Windows.\n\n**Custom Location Behavior**\n\nIf you need to store the certificate configuration file in a non-default location, use the `--credential-cert-configuration-output-file` flag.\n\n**Example Command (Custom Location):**\n```bash\ngcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config \\\n    projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID \\\n    --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \\\n    --credential-cert-path \"$PATH_TO_CERTIFICATE\" \\\n    --credential-cert-private-key-path \"$PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY\" \\\n    --credential-cert-trust-chain-path \"$PATH_TO_TRUST_CHAIN\" \\\n    --credential-cert-configuration-output-file \"/custom/path/cert_config.json\" \\\n    --output-file /path/to/config.json\n``` \n\nUse the default location example as a reference to substitute placeholders.\n\nThis command results in:\n\n- `/path/to/config.json`: Created at the path you specified. This file will contain a `\"certificate_config_location\"` field that points to your custom path.\n- `cert_config.json`: Created at `/custom/path/cert_config.json`, as specified by the flag.\n\n### Accessing resources from an OIDC or SAML2.0 identity provider using a custom supplier\n\nIf you want to use OIDC or SAML2.0 that cannot be retrieved using methods supported natively by this library,\na custom SubjectTokenSupplier implementation may be specified when creating an identity pool client. The supplier must\nreturn a valid, unexpired subject token when called by the GCP credential.\n\nNote that the client does not cache the returned subject token, so caching logic should be implemented in the supplier to prevent multiple requests for the same resources.\n\n```ts\nclass CustomSupplier implements SubjectTokenSupplier {\n  async getSubjectToken(\n    context: ExternalAccountSupplierContext\n  ): Promise<string> {\n    const audience = context.audience;\n    const subjectTokenType = context.subjectTokenType;\n    // Return a valid subject token for the requested audience and subject token type.\n  }\n}\n\nconst clientOptions = {\n  audience: '//iam.googleapis.com/projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$WORKLOAD_POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID', // Set the GCP audience.\n  subject_token_type: 'urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token', // Set the subject token type.\n  subject_token_supplier: new CustomSupplier() // Set the custom supplier.\n}\n\nconst client = new CustomSupplier(clientOptions);\n```\n\nWhere the [audience](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-for-using-workload-identity-federation#provider-audience) is: `//iam.googleapis.com/projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$WORKLOAD_POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID`\n\nWhere the following variables need to be substituted:\n\n* `$PROJECT_NUMBER`: The Google Cloud project number.\n* `$WORKLOAD_POOL_ID`: The workload pool ID.\n* `$PROVIDER_ID`: The provider ID.\n\nThe values for audience, service account impersonation URL, and any other builder field can also be found by generating a [credential configuration file with the gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/workload-identity-pools/create-cred-config).\n\n#### Using External Account Authorized User workforce credentials\n\n[External account authorized user credentials](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-obtaining-short-lived-credentials#browser-based-sign-in) allow you to sign in with a web browser to an external identity provider account via the\ngcloud CLI and create a configuration for the auth library to use.\n\nTo generate an external account authorized user workforce identity configuration, run the following command:\n\n```bash\ngcloud auth application-default login --login-config=$LOGIN_CONFIG\n```\n\nWhere the following variable needs to be substituted:\n- `$LOGIN_CONFIG`: The login config file generated with the cloud console or\n   [gcloud iam workforce-pools create-login-config](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/workforce-pools/create-login-config)\n\nThis will open a browser flow for you to sign in via the configured third party identity provider\nand then will store the external account authorized user configuration at the well known ADC location.\nThe auth library will then use the provided refresh token from the configuration to generate and refresh\nan access token to call Google Cloud services.\n\nNote that the default lifetime of the refresh token is one hour, after which a new configuration will need to be generated from the gcloud CLI.\nThe lifetime can be modified by changing the [session duration of the workforce pool](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/locations.workforcePools), and can be set as high as 12 hours.\n\n#### Using Executable-sourced credentials with OIDC and SAML\n\n**Executable-sourced credentials**\nFor executable-sourced credentials, a local executable is used to retrieve the 3rd party token.\nThe executable must handle providing a valid, unexpired OIDC ID token or SAML assertion in JSON format\nto stdout.\n\nTo use executable-sourced credentials, the `GOOGLE_EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT_ALLOW_EXECUTABLES`\nenvironment variable must be set to `1`.\n\nTo generate an executable-sourced workload identity configuration, run the following command:\n\n```bash\n# Generate a configuration file for executable-sourced credentials.\ngcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config \\\n    projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID \\\n    --service-account=$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \\\n    --subject-token-type=$SUBJECT_TOKEN_TYPE \\\n    # The absolute path for the program, including arguments.\n    # e.g. --executable-command=\"/path/to/command --foo=bar\"\n    --executable-command=$EXECUTABLE_COMMAND \\\n    # Optional argument for the executable timeout. Defaults to 30s.\n    # --executable-timeout-millis=$EXECUTABLE_TIMEOUT \\\n    # Optional argument for the absolute path to the executable output file.\n    # See below on how this argument impacts the library behaviour.\n    # --executable-output-file=$EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_FILE \\\n    --output-file /path/to/generated/config.json\n```\nWhere the following variables need to be substituted:\n- `$PROJECT_NUMBER`: The Google Cloud project number.\n- `$POOL_ID`: The workload identity pool ID.\n- `$PROVIDER_ID`: The OIDC or SAML provider ID.\n- `$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: The email of the service account to impersonate.\n- `$SUBJECT_TOKEN_TYPE`: The subject token type.\n- `$EXECUTABLE_COMMAND`: The full command to run, including arguments. Must be an absolute path to the program.\n\nThe `--executable-timeout-millis` flag is optional. This is the duration for which\nthe auth library will wait for the executable to finish, in milliseconds.\nDefaults to 30 seconds when not provided. The maximum allowed value is 2 minutes.\nThe minimum is 5 seconds.\n\nThe `--executable-output-file` flag is optional. If provided, the file path must\npoint to the 3PI credential response generated by the executable. This is useful\nfor caching the credentials. By specifying this path, the Auth libraries will first\ncheck for its existence before running the executable. By caching the executable JSON\nresponse to this file, it improves performance as it avoids the need to run the executable\nuntil the cached credentials in the output file are expired. The executable must\nhandle writing to this file - the auth libraries will only attempt to read from\nthis location. The format of contents in the file should match the JSON format\nexpected by the executable shown below.\n\nTo retrieve the 3rd party token, the library will call the executable\nusing the command specified. The executable's output must adhere to the response format\nspecified below. It must output the response to stdout.\n\nA sample successful executable OIDC response:\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": 1,\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"token_type\": \"urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token\",\n  \"id_token\": \"HEADER.PAYLOAD.SIGNATURE\",\n  \"expiration_time\": 1620499962\n}\n```\n\nA sample successful executable SAML response:\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": 1,\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"token_type\": \"urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2\",\n  \"saml_response\": \"...\",\n  \"expiration_time\": 1620499962\n}\n```\nFor successful responses, the `expiration_time` field is only required\nwhen an output file is specified in the credential configuration.\n\nA sample executable error response:\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": 1,\n  \"success\": false,\n  \"code\": \"401\",\n  \"message\": \"Caller not authorized.\"\n}\n```\nThese are all required fields for an error response. The code and message\nfields will be used by the library as part of the thrown exception.\n\nResponse format fields summary:\n* `version`: The version of the JSON output. Currently, only version 1 is supported.\n* `success`: The status of the response. When true, the response must contain the 3rd party token\n     and token type. The response must also contain the expiration time if an output file was specified in the credential configuration.\n     The executable must also exit with exit code 0.\n     When false, the response must contain the error code and message fields and exit with a non-zero value.\n* `token_type`: The 3rd party subject token type. Must be *urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt*,\n*urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token*, or *urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2*.\n* `id_token`: The 3rd party OIDC token.\n* `saml_response`: The 3rd party SAML response.\n* `expiration_time`: The 3rd party subject token expiration time in seconds (unix epoch time).\n* `code`: The error code string.\n* `message`: The error message.\n\nAll response types must include both the `version` and `success` fields.\n* Successful responses must include the `token_type` and one of\n`id_token` or `saml_response`. The `expiration_time` field must also be present if an output file was specified in\nthe credential configuration.\n* Error responses must include both the `code` and `message` fields.\n\nThe library will populate the following environment variables when the executable is run:\n* `GOOGLE_EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT_AUDIENCE`: The audience field from the credential configuration. Always present.\n* `GOOGLE_EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT_IMPERSONATED_EMAIL`: The service account email. Only present when service account impersonation is used.\n* `GOOGLE_EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT_OUTPUT_FILE`: The output file location from the credential configuration. Only present when specified in the credential configuration.\n* `GOOGLE_EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_TYPE`: This expected subject token type. Always present.\n\nThese environment variables can be used by the executable to avoid hard-coding these values.\n\n##### Security considerations\nThe following security practices are highly recommended:\n* Access to the script should be restricted as it will be displaying credentials to stdout. This ensures that rogue processes do not gain  access to the script.\n* The configuration file should not be modifiable. Write access should be restricted to avoid processes modifying the executable command portion.\n\nGiven the complexity of using executable-sourced credentials, it is recommended to use\nthe existing supported mechanisms (file-sourced/URL-sourced) for providing 3rd party\ncredentials unless they do not meet your specific requirements.\n\nYou can now [use the Auth library](#using-external-identities) to call Google Cloud\nresources from an OIDC or SAML provider.\n\n#### Configurable Token Lifetime\nWhen creating a credential configuration with workload identity federation using service account impersonation, you can provide an optional argument to configure the service account access token lifetime.\n\nTo generate the configuration with configurable token lifetime, run the following command (this example uses an AWS configuration, but the token lifetime can be configured for all workload identity federation providers):\n\n```bash\n# Generate an AWS configuration file with configurable token lifetime.\ngcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config \\\n    projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$POOL_ID/providers/$AWS_PROVIDER_ID \\\n    --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \\\n    --aws \\\n    --output-file /path/to/generated/config.json \\\n    --service-account-token-lifetime-seconds $TOKEN_LIFETIME\n```\n\n Where the following variables need to be substituted:\n- `$PROJECT_NUMBER`: The Google Cloud project number.\n- `$POOL_ID`: The workload identity pool ID.\n- `$AWS_PROVIDER_ID`: The AWS provider ID.\n- `$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: The email of the service account to impersonate.\n- `$TOKEN_LIFETIME`: The desired lifetime duration of the service account access token in seconds.\n\nThe `service-account-token-lifetime-seconds` flag is optional. If not provided, this defaults to one hour.\nThe minimum allowed value is 600 (10 minutes) and the maximum allowed value is 43200 (12 hours).\nIf a lifetime greater than one hour is required, the service account must be added as an allowed value in an Organization Policy that enforces the `constraints/iam.allowServiceAccountCredentialLifetimeExtension` constraint.\n\nNote that configuring a short lifetime (e.g. 10 minutes) will result in the library initiating the entire token exchange flow every 10 minutes, which will call the 3rd party token provider even if the 3rd party token is not expired.\n\n## Workforce Identity Federation\n\n[Workforce identity federation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation) lets you use an\nexternal identity provider (IdP) to authenticate and authorize a workforce—a group of users, such as employees,\npartners, and contractors—using IAM, so that the users can access Google Cloud services. Workforce identity federation\nextends Google Cloud's identity capabilities to support syncless, attribute-based single sign on.\n\nWith workforce identity federation, your workforce can access Google Cloud resources using an external\nidentity provider (IdP) that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) or SAML 2.0 such as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD),\nActive Directory Federation Services (AD FS), Okta, and others.\n\n### Accessing resources using an OIDC or SAML 2.0 identity provider\n\nIn order to access Google Cloud resources from an identity provider that supports [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/connect/),\nthe following requirements are needed:\n- A workforce identity pool needs to be created.\n- An OIDC or SAML 2.0 identity provider needs to be added in the workforce pool.\n\nFollow the detailed [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/configuring-workforce-identity-federation) on how\nto configure workforce identity federation.\n\nAfter configuring an OIDC or SAML 2.0 provider, a credential configuration\nfile needs to be generated. The generated credential configuration file contains non-sensitive metadata to instruct the\nlibrary on how to retrieve external subject tokens and exchange them for GCP access tokens.\nThe configuration file can be generated by using the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).\n\nThe Auth library can retrieve external subject tokens from a local file location\n(file-sourced credentials), from a local server (URL-sourced credentials) or by calling an executable\n(executable-sourced credentials).\n\n**File-sourced credentials**\nFor file-sourced credentials, a background process needs to be continuously refreshing the file\nlocation with a new subject token prior to expiration. For tokens with one hour lifetimes, the token\nneeds to be updated in the file every hour. The token can be stored directly as plain text or in\nJSON format.\n\nTo generate a file-sourced OIDC configuration, run the following command:\n\n```bash\n# Generate an OIDC configuration file for file-sourced credentials.\ngcloud iam workforce-pools create-cred-config \\\n    locations/global/workforcePools/$WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID \\\n    --subject-token-type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token \\\n    --credential-source-file=$PATH_TO_OIDC_ID_TOKEN \\\n    --workforce-pool-user-project=$WORKFORCE_POOL_USER_PROJECT \\\n    # Optional arguments for file types. Default is \"text\":\n    # --credential-source-type \"json\" \\\n    # Optional argument for the field that contains the OIDC credential.\n    # This is required for json.\n    # --credential-source-field-name \"id_token\" \\\n    --output-file=/path/to/generated/config.json\n```\nWhere the following variables need to be substituted:\n- `$WORKFORCE_POOL_ID`: The workforce pool ID.\n- `$PROVIDER_ID`: The provider ID.\n- `$PATH_TO_OIDC_ID_TOKEN`: The file path used to retrieve the OIDC token.\n- `$WORKFORCE_POOL_USER_PROJECT`: The project number associated with the [workforce pools user project](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#workforce-pools-user-project).\n\nTo generate a file-sourced SAML configuration, run the following command:\n\n```bash\n# Generate a SAML configuration file for file-sourced credentials.\ngcloud iam workforce-pools create-cred-config \\\n    locations/global/workforcePools/$WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID \\\n    --credential-source-file=$PATH_TO_SAML_ASSERTION \\\n    --subject-token-type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2 \\\n    --workforce-pool-user-project=$WORKFORCE_POOL_USER_PROJECT \\\n    --output-file=/path/to/generated/config.json\n```\n\nWhere the following variables need to be substituted:\n- `$WORKFORCE_POOL_ID`: The workforce pool ID.\n- `$PROVIDER_ID`: The provider ID.\n- `$PATH_TO_SAML_ASSERTION`: The file path used to retrieve the base64-encoded SAML assertion.\n- `$WORKFORCE_POOL_USER_PROJECT`: The project number associated with the [workforce pools user project](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#workforce-pools-user-project).\n\nThese commands generate the configuration file in the specified output file.\n\n**URL-sourced credentials**\nFor URL-sourced credentials, a local server needs to host a GET endpoint to return the OIDC token.\nThe response can be in plain text or JSON. Additional required request headers can also be\nspecified.\n\nTo generate a URL-sourced OIDC workforce identity configuration, run the following command:\n\n```bash\n# Generate an OIDC configuration file for URL-sourced credentials.\ngcloud iam workforce-pools create-cred-config \\\n    locations/global/workforcePools/$WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID \\\n    --subject-token-type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token \\\n    --credential-source-url=$URL_TO_RETURN_OIDC_ID_TOKEN \\\n    --credential-source-headers $HEADER_KEY=$HEADER_VALUE \\\n    --workforce-pool-user-project=$WORKFORCE_POOL_USER_PROJECT \\\n    --output-file=/path/to/generated/config.json\n```\n\nWhere the following variables need to be substituted:\n- `$WORKFORCE_POOL_ID`: The workforce pool ID.\n- `$PROVIDER_ID`: The provider ID.\n- `$URL_TO_RETURN_OIDC_ID_TOKEN`: The URL of the local server endpoint.\n- `$HEADER_KEY` and `$HEADER_VALUE`: The additional header key/value pairs to pass along the GET request to\n   `$URL_TO_GET_OIDC_TOKEN`, e.g. `Metadata-Flavor=Google`.\n- `$WORKFORCE_POOL_USER_PROJECT`: The project number associated with the [workforce pools user project](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#workforce-pools-user-project).\n\nTo generate a URL-sourced SAML configuration, run the following command:\n\n```bash\n# Generate a SAML configuration file for file-sourced credentials.\ngcloud iam workforce-pools create-cred-config \\\n    locations/global/workforcePools/$WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID \\\n    --subject-token-type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2 \\\n    --credential-source-url=$URL_TO_GET_SAML_ASSERTION \\\n    --credential-source-headers $HEADER_KEY=$HEADER_VALUE \\\n    --workforce-pool-user-project=$WORKFORCE_POOL_USER_PROJECT \\\n    --output-file=/path/to/generated/config.json\n```\n\nThese commands generate the configuration file in the specified output file.\n\nWhere the following variables need to be substituted:\n- `$WORKFORCE_POOL_ID`: The workforce pool ID.\n- `$PROVIDER_ID`: The provider ID.\n- `$URL_TO_GET_SAML_ASSERTION`: The URL of the local server endpoint.\n- `$HEADER_KEY` and `$HEADER_VALUE`: The additional header key/value pairs to pass along the GET request to\n     `$URL_TO_GET_SAML_ASSERTION`, e.g. `Metadata-Flavor=Google`.\n- `$WORKFORCE_POOL_USER_PROJECT`: The project number associated with the [workforce pools user project](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#workforce-pools-user-project).\n\n### Using Executable-sourced workforce credentials with OIDC and SAML\n\n**Executable-sourced credentials**\nFor executable-sourced credentials, a local executable is used to retrieve the 3rd party token.\nThe executable must handle providing a valid, unexpired OIDC ID token or SAML assertion in JSON format\nto stdout.\n\nTo use executable-sourced credentials, the `GOOGLE_EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT_ALLOW_EXECUTABLES`\nenvironment variable must be set to `1`.\n\nTo generate an executable-sourced workforce identity configuration, run the following command:\n\n```bash\n# Generate a configuration file for executable-sourced credentials.\ngcloud iam workforce-pools create-cred-config \\\n    locations/global/workforcePools/$WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID \\\n    --subject-token-type=$SUBJECT_TOKEN_TYPE \\\n    # The absolute path for the program, including arguments.\n    # e.g. --executable-command=\"/path/to/command --foo=bar\"\n    --executable-command=$EXECUTABLE_COMMAND \\\n    # Optional argument for the executable timeout.

Must be an absolute path to the program.\n- `$WORKFORCE_POOL_USER_PROJECT`: The project number associated with the [workforce pools user project](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#workforce-pools-user-project).\n\nThe `--executable-timeout-millis` flag is optional. This is the duration for which\nthe auth library will wait for the executable to finish, in milliseconds.\nDefaults to 30 seconds when not provided. The maximum allowed value is 2 minutes.\nThe minimum is 5 seconds.\n\nThe `--executable-output-file` flag is optional.

The supplier must\nreturn a valid, unexpired subject token when called by the GCP credential.\n\nNote that the client does not cache the returned subject token, so caching logic should be implemented in the supplier to prevent multiple requests for the same resources.\n\n```ts\nclass CustomSupplier implements SubjectTokenSupplier {\n  async getSubjectToken(\n    context: ExternalAccountSupplierContext\n  ): Promise<string> {\n    const audience = context.audience;\n    const subjectTokenType = context.subjectTokenType;\n    // Return a valid subject token for the requested audience and subject token type.\n  }\n}\n\nconst clientOptions = {\n  audience: '//iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/$WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID', // Set the GCP audience.\n  subject_token_type: 'urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token', // Set the subject token type.\n  subject_token_supplier: new CustomSupplier() // Set the custom supplier.\n}\n\nconst client = new CustomSupplier(clientOptions);\n```\n\nWhere the audience is: `//iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/$WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID`\n\nWhere the following variables need to be substituted:\n\n* `$WORKFORCE_POOL_ID`: The worforce pool ID.\n* `$PROVIDER_ID`: The provider ID.\n\nand the workforce pool user project is the project number associated with the [workforce pools user project](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#workforce-pools-user-project).\n\nThe values for audience, service account impersonation URL, and any other builder field can also be found by generating a [credential configuration file with the gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-obtaining-short-lived-credentials#use_configuration_files_for_sign-in).\n\nFor a sample on how to access Google Cloud resources from an Okta identity provider with a custom credential supplier, see [samples/customCredentialSupplierOktaWorkload.js](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs/blob/main/samples/customCredentialSupplierOktaWorkload.js).\n\n### Using External Identities\n\nExternal identities (AWS, Azure and OIDC-based providers) can be used with `Application Default Credentials`.\nIn order to use external identities with Application Default Credentials, you need to generate the JSON credentials configuration file for your external identity as described above.\nOnce generated, store the path to this file in the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.\n\n```bash\nexport GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/config.json\n```\n\nThe library can now automatically choose the right type of client and initialize credentials from the context provided in the configuration file.\n\n```js\nconst auth = new GoogleAuth({\n  scopes: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'\n});\nconst projectId = await auth.getProjectId();\n// List all buckets in a project.\nconst url = `https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b?project=${projectId}`;\nconst res = await client.fetch(url);\nconsole.log(res.data);\n```\n\nWhen using external identities with Application Default Credentials in Node.js, the `roles/browser` role needs to be granted to the service account.\nThe `Cloud Resource Manager API` should also be enabled on the project.\nThis is needed since the library will try to auto-discover the project ID from the current environment using the impersonated credential.\nTo avoid this requirement, the project ID can be explicitly specified on initialization.\n\n```js\nconst auth = new GoogleAuth({\n  scopes: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',\n  // Pass the project ID explicitly to avoid the need to grant `roles/browser` to the service account\n  // or enable Cloud Resource Manager API on the project.\n  projectId: 'CLOUD_RESOURCE_PROJECT_ID',\n});\n```\n\nYou can also explicitly initialize external account clients using the generated configuration file.\n\n```js\nconst {ExternalAccountClient} = require('google-auth-library');\nconst jsonConfig = require('/path/to/config.json');\n\nconst client = ExternalAccountClient.fromJSON(jsonConfig);\nclient.scopes = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'];\n// List all buckets in a project.\nconst url = `https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b?project=${projectId}`;\nconst res = await client.fetch(url);\nconsole.log(res.data);\n```\n\n#### Security Considerations\nNote that this library does not perform any validation on the token_url, token_info_url, or service_account_impersonation_url fields of the credential configuration. It is not recommended to use a credential configuration that you did not generate with the gcloud CLI unless you verify that the URL fields point to a googleapis.com domain.\n\n## Working with ID Tokens\n### Fetching ID Tokens\nIf your application is running on Cloud Run or Cloud Functions, or using Cloud Identity-Aware\nProxy (IAP), you will need to fetch an ID token to access your application. For\nthis, use the method `getIdTokenClient` on the `GoogleAuth` client.\n\nFor invoking Cloud Run services, your service account will need the\n[`Cloud Run Invoker`](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/authenticating/service-to-service)\nIAM permission.\n\nFor invoking Cloud Functions, your service account will need the\n[`Function Invoker`](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/securing/authenticating#function-to-function)\nIAM permission.\n\n``` js\n// Make a request to a protected Cloud Run service.\nconst {GoogleAuth} = require('google-auth-library');\n\nconst url = 'https://cloud-run-1234-uc.a.run.app';\nconst auth = new GoogleAuth();\nconst client = await auth.getIdTokenClient(url);\nconst res = await client.fetch(url);\nconsole.log(res.data);\n```\n\nA complete example can be found in [`samples/idtokens-serverless.js`](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs/blob/main/samples/idtokens-serverless.js).\n\nFor invoking Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy, you will need to pass the Client ID\nused when you set up your protected resource as the target audience.\n\n``` js\n// Make a request to a protected Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) resource\nconst {GoogleAuth} = require('google-auth-library');\n\nconst targetAudience = 'iap-client-id';\nconst url = 'https://iap-url.com';\nconst auth = new GoogleAuth();\nconst client = await auth.getIdTokenClient(targetAudience);\nconst res = await client.fetch(url);\nconsole.log(res.data);\n```\n\nA complete example can be found in [`samples/idtokens-iap.js`](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs/blob/main/samples/idtokens-iap.js).\n\n### Verifying ID Tokens\n\nIf you've [secured your IAP app with signed headers](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/signed-headers-howto),\nyou can use this library to verify the IAP header:\n\n```js\nconst {OAuth2Client} = require('google-auth-library');\n// Expected audience for App Engine.\nconst expectedAudience = `/projects/your-project-number/apps/your-project-id`;\n// IAP issuer\nconst issuers = ['https://cloud.google.com/iap'];\n// Verify the token. OAuth2Client throws an Error if verification fails\nconst oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client();\nconst response = await oAuth2Client.getIapCerts();\nconst ticket = await oAuth2Client.verifySignedJwtWithCertsAsync(\n  idToken,\n  response.pubkeys,\n  expectedAudience,\n  issuers\n);\n\n// Print out the info contained in the IAP ID token\nconsole.log(ticket)\n```\n\nA complete example can be found in [`samples/verifyIdToken-iap.js`](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs/blob/main/samples/verifyIdToken-iap.js).\n\n## Impersonated Credentials Client\n\nGoogle Cloud Impersonated credentials used for [Creating short-lived service account credentials](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-short-lived-service-account-credentials).\n\nProvides authentication for applications where local credentials impersonates a remote service account using [IAM Credentials API](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/credentials/rest).\n\nAn Impersonated Credentials Client is instantiated with a `sourceClient`. This\nclient should use credentials that have the \"Service Account Token Creator\" role (`roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`),\nand should authenticate with the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`, or `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/iam` scopes.\n\n`sourceClient` is used by the Impersonated\nCredentials Client to impersonate a target service account with a specified\nset of scopes.\n\n### Sample Usage\n\n```javascript\nconst { GoogleAuth, Impersonated } = require('google-auth-library');\nconst { SecretManagerServiceClient } = require('@google-cloud/secret-manager');\n\nasync function main() {\n\n  // Acquire source credentials:\n  const auth = new GoogleAuth();\n  const client = await auth.getClient();\n\n  // Impersonate new credentials:\n  let targetClient = new Impersonated({\n    sourceClient: client,\n    targetPrincipal: 'impersonated-account@projectID.iam.gserviceaccount.com',\n    lifetime: 30,\n    delegates: [],\n    targetScopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform']\n  });\n\n  // Get impersonated credentials:\n  const authHeaders = await targetClient.getRequestHeaders();\n  // Do something with `authHeaders.get('authorization')`.\n\n  // Use impersonated credentials:\n  const url = 'https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b?project=anotherProjectID'\n  const resp = await targetClient.fetch(url);\n  for (const bucket of resp.data.items) {\n    console.log(bucket.name);\n  }\n\n  // Use impersonated credentials with google-cloud client library\n  // Note: this works only with certain cloud client libraries utilizing gRPC\n  //    e.g., SecretManager, KMS, AIPlatform\n  // will not currently work with libraries using REST, e.g., Storage, Compute\n  const smClient = new SecretManagerServiceClient({\n    projectId: anotherProjectID,\n    auth: {\n      getClient: () => targetClient,\n    },\n  });\n  const secretName = 'projects/anotherProjectNumber/secrets/someProjectName/versions/1';\n  const [accessResponse] = await smClient.accessSecretVersion({\n    name: secretName,\n  });\n\n  const responsePayload = accessResponse.payload.data.toString('utf8');\n  // Do something with the secret contained in `responsePayload`.\n};\n\nmain();\n```\n\n## Downscoped Client\n\n[Downscoping with Credential Access Boundaries](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/downscoping-short-lived-credentials) is used to restrict the Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions that a short-lived credential can use.\n\nThe `DownscopedClient` class can be used to produce a downscoped access token from a\n`CredentialAccessBoundary` and a source credential. The Credential Access Boundary specifies which resources the newly created credential can access, as well as an upper bound on the permissions that are available on each resource. Using downscoped credentials ensures tokens in flight always have the least privileges, e.g. Principle of Least Privilege.\n\n> Notice: Only Cloud Storage supports Credential Access Boundaries for now.\n\n### Sample Usage\nThere are two entities needed to generate and use credentials generated from\nDownscoped Client with Credential Access Boundaries.\n\n- Token broker: This is the entity with elevated permissions. This entity has the permissions needed to generate downscoped tokens. The common pattern of usage is to have a token broker with elevated access generate these downscoped credentials from higher access source credentials and pass the downscoped short-lived access tokens to a token consumer via some secure authenticated channel for limited access to Google Cloud Storage resources.\n\n``` js\nconst {GoogleAuth, DownscopedClient} = require('google-auth-library');\n// Define CAB rules which will restrict the downscoped token to have readonly\n// access to objects starting with \"customer-a\" in bucket \"bucket_name\".\nconst cabRules = {\n  accessBoundary: {\n    accessBoundaryRules: [\n      {\n        availableResource: `//storage.googleapis.com/projects/_/buckets/bucket_name`,\n        availablePermissions: ['inRole:roles/storage.objectViewer'],\n        availabilityCondition: {\n          expression:\n            `resource.name.startsWith('projects/_/buckets/` +\n            `bucket_name/objects/customer-a)`\n        }\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n};\n\n// This will use ADC to get the credentials used for the downscoped client.\nconst googleAuth = new GoogleAuth({\n  scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform']\n});\n\n// Obtain an authenticated client via ADC.\nconst client = await googleAuth.getClient();\n\n// Use the client to create a DownscopedClient.\nconst cabClient = new DownscopedClient({authClient: client, credentialAccessBoundary: cab});\n\n// Refresh the tokens.\nconst refreshedAccessToken = await cabClient.getAccessToken();\n\n// This will need to be passed to the token consumer.\naccess_token = refreshedAccessToken.token;\nexpiry_date = refreshedAccessToken.expirationTime;\n```\n\nA token broker can be set up on a server in a private network. Various workloads\n(token consumers) in the same network will send authenticated requests to that broker for downscoped tokens to access or modify specific google cloud storage buckets.\n\nThe broker will instantiate downscoped credentials instances that can be used to generate short lived downscoped access tokens which will be passed to the token consumer.\n\n- Token consumer: This is the consumer of the downscoped tokens. This entity does not have the direct ability to generate access tokens and instead relies on the token broker to provide it with downscoped tokens to run operations on GCS buckets. It is assumed that the downscoped token consumer may have its own mechanism to authenticate itself with the token broker.\n\n``` js\nconst {OAuth2Client} = require('google-auth-library');\nconst {Storage} = require('@google-cloud/storage');\n\n// Create the OAuth credentials (the consumer).\nconst oauth2Client = new OAuth2Client();\n// We are defining a refresh handler instead of a one-time access\n// token/expiry pair.\n// This will allow the consumer to obtain new downscoped tokens on\n// demand every time a token is expired, without any additional code\n// changes.\noauth2Client.refreshHandler = async () => {\n  // The common pattern of usage is to have a token broker pass the\n  // downscoped short-lived access tokens to a token consumer via some\n  // secure authenticated channel.\n  const refreshedAccessToken = await cabClient.getAccessToken();\n  return {\n    access_token: refreshedAccessToken.token,\n    expiry_date: refreshedAccessToken.expirationTime,\n  }\n};\n\n// Use the consumer client to define storageOptions and create a GCS object.\nconst storageOptions = {\n  projectId: 'my_project_id',\n  authClient: oauth2Client,\n};\n\nconst storage = new Storage(storageOptions);\n\nconst downloadFile = await storage\n    .bucket('bucket_name')\n    .file('customer-a-data.txt')\n    .download();\nconsole.log(downloadFile.toString('utf8'));\n\nmain().catch(console.error);\n```\n\n\n## Samples\n\nSamples are in the [`samples/`](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs/tree/main/samples) directory.

schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).\nLibraries are compatible with all current _active_ and _maintenance_ versions of\nNode.js.\nIf you are using an end-of-life version of Node.js, we recommend that you update\nas soon as possible to an actively supported LTS version.\n\nGoogle's client libraries support legacy versions of Node.js runtimes on a\nbest-efforts basis with the following warnings:\n\n* Legacy versions are not tested in continuous integration.\n* Some security patches and features cannot be backported.\n* Dependencies cannot be kept up-to-date.\n\nClient libraries targeting some end-of-life versions of Node.js are available, and\ncan be installed through npm [dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag).\nThe dist-tags follow the naming convention `legacy-(version)`.\nFor example, `npm install google-auth-library@legacy-8` installs client libraries\nfor versions compatible with Node.js 8.\n\n## Versioning\n\nThis library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).\n\n\n\nThis library is considered to be **stable**. The code surface will not change in backwards-incompatible ways\nunless absolutely necessary (e.g. because of critical security issues) or with\nan extensive deprecation period. Issues and requests against **stable** libraries\nare addressed with the highest priority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Information: [Google Cloud Platform Launch Stages][launch_stages]\n\n[launch_stages]: https://cloud.google.com/terms/launch-stages\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome!
